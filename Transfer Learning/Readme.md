# Transfer Learning Informations

Transfer Learning is a machine learning method where we reuse a pre-trained model as the starting for a model on new task.

By applying transfer learning to a new task, one can achive significantly higher performance than traning with only a small amount of data.

Transfer learning is so common that it is rare to train a model for an image-related tasks from stratch
