# Image-Data-Augmentation

As you can see in the notebook, I have performed several transformation operations that will be very simple. By making changes to these transform structures, you can provide the image augmentation or data augmentation you want. 

If there is a part that you can't make sense of, I suggest that you first research the function on the Pytorch website, but if you don't get enough information, you can also contact me.
